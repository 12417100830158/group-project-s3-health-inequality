One has a zip line and rope based play area. There were two other play areas for younger children and toddlers too. You could still see some of the animals from the petting zoo.

It really is a nice park that sits off the highway but the noise was reasonable and if you venture away from the play structures you won't even be bothered by the highway noise. There are several walking paths, garden stops, and bikes are not allowed so it allowed us to let our kids roam a bit more freely.

And you being a sane human being, of course you'll do the same and pull some grass out of the ground as an offering and then... WHAT? A mini train emerges out of the greenery. What is happening? And as you start to explore you get to experience lush flora and fauna, gorgeous garden architecture inspired from all over the world, fountains, a labyrinth, wildlife, cute cafés... everything!! And you can still, which blows my mind, STILL go full blown forest fairy mode and immerse yourself in nature by yourself and avoid your angry mini golfer uncle and the crying kids in the pancake line.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VPYXV6TnFSdkltTHhRRRAB,5.0,"Amstelpark is one of Amsterdam’s hidden gems — a beautifully maintained park offering something for everyone, from peaceful gardens to exciting events. Located near the Amstel River in the south of the city, it was originally built for the 1972 Floriade and remains a place where nature and culture blend perfectly.

The park features themed gardens, including a Japanese garden, rose garden, and rhododendron valley, as well as art installations, walking trails, a miniature train, and a petting zoo. Families, joggers, photographers, and nature lovers all find something to enjoy here.

But Amstelpark isn’t just about quiet strolls. From June 13 to 15, 2025, it hosts BITE of Amsterdam — one of the country’s top food festivals. The event transforms the park into a vibrant outdoor dining experience, featuring dishes from renowned Dutch chefs, Michelin-level restaurants, food trucks, and street food vendors. You can explore tasting tours, chef demos, wine and champagne bars, and kid-friendly zones like Little Bite.

There’s live music, DJ sets, and cozy lounges set up across the park, making it the perfect spot to enjoy summer vibes with great food and drinks. Sustainability is also a focus, with eco-friendly food options and minimal waste.

Easily accessible by public transport or bike, Amstelpark is perfect for a weekend outing or a spontaneous weekday escape. Whether you’re into gardens, gourmet bites, or just a sunny afternoon in nature, Amstelpark delivers a full experience all year round — especially in June.",2025-06-09T13:46:40Z,

Rating: ★★★★☆

Amstelpark, located in the vibrant city of Amsterdam, offers a delightful escape from the bustling urban environment. This expansive park is a hidden gem that beautifully combines natural beauty with recreational activities, making it a popular destination for locals and tourists alike.

One of the standout features of Amstelpark is its lush greenery, meticulously manicured gardens, and serene water bodies. As you step into the park, you are greeted by a sense of tranquility that instantly washes away the stresses of everyday life. The well-maintained pathways meander through colorful flower beds, ornamental shrubs, and tall trees, providing a picturesque setting for a leisurely stroll or a peaceful picnic.

The park's diverse attractions cater to people of all ages and interests. Nature enthusiasts will find solace in the Amstel riverbank, where they can enjoy a scenic walk or sit back and watch the boats gently glide by. The Japanese Zen garden is a true masterpiece, transporting visitors to a serene and contemplative space. Meanwhile, families can spend quality time at the playgrounds, which are equipped with modern facilities and ample space for children to play and explore.

One of the highlights of Amstelpark is the Amstelpark Railway, a miniature train system that takes visitors on a charming ride around the park. Both children and adults will find delight in this nostalgic experience, as they chug along the tracks and take in the sights. The park also offers other recreational activities such as mini-golf, a maze, and a petting zoo, ensuring there is always something to entertain everyone.

For those seeking a cultural experience, Amstelpark houses the Amsterdam Forest Theatre, a unique open-air theater that hosts various performances throughout the year. Whether it's a play, a concert, or a dance show, the theater adds an artistic touch to the park, making it an ideal destination for culture enthusiasts.

Amstelpark is also well-equipped with facilities to ensure visitors' comfort. Clean restrooms, cozy cafés, and picnic areas are strategically placed throughout the park, providing ample opportunities to relax and rejuvenate. The staff members are friendly and helpful, offering guidance and information to make your visit as enjoyable as possible.

The only slight drawback of Amstelpark is that during peak tourist seasons, it can get crowded, especially on weekends. However, with its vast expanse, there is usually enough space to find a peaceful spot away from the crowds.

Overall, Amstelpark is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a tranquil escape within Amsterdam. Its combination of natural beauty, recreational activities, and cultural offerings make it a well-rounded park that appeals to visitors of all ages. Whether you're looking for a place to unwind, enjoy a family outing, or immerse yourself in nature, Amstelpark delivers a truly delightful experience.",2023-05-24T09:23:03Z,

On the other hand, if you're looking for some peace and quiet, walks in the early morning hours (see the white mist shrouding the waters of the pond) and late in the afternoon, when the crowds have gone home, are a joy.  The park is for pedestrians only (shame though that some people ignore the signs to leave their bike outside the gates).
