1,3.0,"Great campsite for metro trip into Amsterdam, otherwise you are stranded if you don't have transport. Nowhere to go for food, drink(unless summer holiday season), would not walk to and from metro station when dark as you have to walk through a very dodgy carpark.
Facilities were good and mostly very clean, but odd days had obviously been left uncleaned.
Good for laundry washing.",en,2025-09-24,Gaasperpark

There are areas in the park with different topics and playgrounds. Water is a big theme in this park. You can play with the water or in the water. The park also has facilities like toilets and food-selling booths. During Spring, Summer and early Autumn, it’s great to settle down to have a picnic with family and friends. In the Winter - if there is snow - you may use your sledge to run down the slope. It’s easy to get there by metro, by bus or by car. If you are adventurous enough, it’s possible to bike towards Gaasperpark.",en,2025-09-19,Gaasperpark

I bagni sono puliti ma per quanto riguarda la mia esperienza forse non sono abbastanza numericamente per la quantità di ospiti che può contenere il campeggio. Ho fatto la fila sia per andare in bagno che per lavare i piatti.
(Altro piccolo consiglio per i gestori: qualche gancio nella zona lavandini per appendere borse e asciugamani).
Per il resto, il campeggio è super comodo per raggiungere il centro di Amsterdam. A 5 minuti a piedi c'è la stazione della metro che porta direttamente alla stazione centrale della città. Insomma un buon appoggio per passare la giornata in città",en,2025-08-10,Gaasperpark

Ik heb een geweldige tijd gehad op Reggae Lake.
Het was gezellig, ontspannen en er werd flink gefeest.
Het park was mooi versierd.
Het nadeel: het was behoorlijk ver lopen naar de auto.
Het parkeertarief van 20 euro is wel een beetje hoog. En je moet te voet terug. Er waren wel golfkarretjes, maar dat was het dan. De paden waren slecht verlicht en er waren weinig aanwijzingen.
De camping leek gezellig, maar met een rit van 20 minuten naar huis was dat niet nodig.
Het is zeker een aanrader voor het hele gezin. Oké, hier en daar wordt er wat wiet gerookt, maar dat hoort bij de levensstijl van de rastafari.",en,2023-08-21,Gaasperpark

638,4.0,"Il campeggio è ben posizionato rispetto al centro della città, facilmente raggiungibile dalla linea della metro a circa 300 m. dal campeggio. I biglietti dei mezzi pubblici sono acquistabili direttamente in reception. All'interno del campeggio c'è un piccolo market, non fornitissimo, ma comunque dove poter acquistare pane fresco durante tutta la giornata e alcuni altri prodotti primari. L'organizzazione del personale è ottima e gestisce con facilità gli accessi. Il personale è disponibile a fornire info utili per gli ospiti.
Le piazzole sono pulite, ordinate e molto curate, alcune su prato e altre su autobloccanti.
I servizi igienici sono abbastanza adeguati al numero degli ospiti e abbastanza puliti, tuttavia gli specchi sopra i lavandini sono posizionati ad un'altezza troppo elevata e, a meno che non si abbia un'altezza di almeno 1.90 m., ci si vede solo i capelli. Docce e spogliatoi comodi.
Punti critici sono:
- lavandini per piatti, lavatoi per vestiti e lavatrici, in numero assolutamente insufficiente rispetto alle persone. In ogni corpo bagni ci sono, infatti, solo 5 lavandini piatti, 1 lavatoio e 2 lavatrici (!!), pertanto ci si trova a fare code interminabili.
- area service, 1 sola in tutto il camping.
In periodi in cui si prevede grande affluenza conviene contattare la struttura per prenotare la piazzola. Campeggio non economico, tuttavia in linea con quello che offre e con i prezzi di campeggi nella zona.",en,2023-08-28,Gaasperpark
