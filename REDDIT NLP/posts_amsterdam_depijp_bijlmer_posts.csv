1q1crae,Amsterdam,Waar haal ik betaalbaar BBQ-vlees in Amsterdam?,"Hoi Reddit,

Ik heb nog een laat kerstdinetje waar het hoofdgerecht op mijn bord geschoven werd. Dus ik ga een BBQstuk uit de oven maken met liquid smoke. 

Was gisteren bij een slager in depijp en kon daar €17 aftikken voor een stukje dat  in een Happy Meal zou verdwalen.

Dus ik zoek hulp. Ik ben op zoek naar een slager ergens in Amsterdam waar ik een stuk runder vlees kan scoren  denk aan schouderstuk / borststuk / rundernek / dat soort werk vlees voor langzaam garen.  
Mag ruw, mag groot, maar goedkoop dus en zolang het low en slow kan en een beetje draden trekt.

1psxlpc,Amsterdam,"Hi everyone, my cat Momo gone missing on Wednesday 17-12-2025.","She is last seen at Blasiusstraat 34, Amsterdam Oost

She is a 4kg tabby cat with white lower body and black - brown tabby stripes covering from her head all the way to her tail. What is special about her:

- Very long tail

- A heart-shaped spot on her right thigh

- A white stroke on her brown back

She is very shy, scared of people, cautious, and not vocal at all. Her hissing is just a wide-opened mouth at best. She doesn't know her name and doesn't wear a collar. 

If anyone sees her around Wibautstraat, Roeterseiland, Oosterpark, de Pijp, Amstelstation, or along Amstel river, please send a picture and location to my whatsapp +31 6 8704 2818

Does anyone know who he is or what his story might be?

Is he possibly part of an organized group or being exploited?

Why doesn’t GVB intervene? Are they aware of him?

I received yesterday my treatment, this time I even had longer lashes than before, as I have been using a castor oil serum...

I told Yana I was gonna be late 10-12 min, I come from a village close to Amsterdam, and do to the work in the road of Noord AMsterdam, the public transport it is chaos, and unpredicted, so I can not do nothing about it! even though, I managed to ARRIVE 6 min late, not more.

I paid 75 eur, like always, but the result were a huge dissapointment.... I asked her, did you apply the serum? as after this the eyelash looks way thicker and fuller...

she said yes, they are wet,later willl look better... LIE

after hours my eyelash were as I left, not curled like always.

I told her i wasnt happy, she did not offer do do it right without cost, or give me back the money, she did not take responsabilty in her action, or apologised, which is what made me the most angry.... after so long.

The funniest is that day i bring her a little present, and in the past i bring her soup from the Suriname restaurant next door!

this is how Yana  treats a humble client...

at the end she showed that she only cares about making money... and this is not only case, in treatwell another girl had similar situation.

1o35ns6,Amsterdam,Is it safe and reasonable to bike from Bullewijk (Zuidoost) to Zuid/RAI?,"https://preview.redd.it/2hzd93ev8buf1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be964df1366f0af986079018a8a54ba58377ca2b

Hi all,

I’m considering biking from Bullewijk station (Amsterdam Zuidoost) to Amsterdam Zuid or RAI for my commute, and I’m wondering how realistic this is. Google Maps shows it’s around 8–10 km, which doesn’t sound too bad, but I have a few concerns:

* Some stretches look quite remote, with little lighting or housing nearby — is it safe to bike there, especially in the evenings?
* How much does wind affect the ride, especially along the Amstel or more open areas?
* Do people regularly make this commute by bike, or is it more common to just take the train/metro instead?

Would love to hear from anyone with experience on this route — whether it’s worth it, or if public transport is the smarter choice.

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the insights so far! Just to add context, I’m a 28-year-old female. I wonder if that might change the experience, especially biking alone in the evenings.",1760113643.0,38,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1o35ns6/is_it_safe_and_reasonable_to_bike_from_bullewijk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1o35ns6/is_it_safe_and_reasonable_to_bike_from_bullewijk/,"Is it safe and reasonable to bike from Bullewijk (Zuidoost) to Zuid/RAI? https://preview.redd.it/2hzd93ev8buf1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be964df1366f0af986079018a8a54ba58377ca2b

1nxqh09,Amsterdam,Nightlife in Amsterdam sucks,"I was out yesterday with some friends, and I don't know if I wasn't drunk enough, or I'm not young enough, but everything I saw (and heard) was just......quite bad.

We did some bar hopping, and it was the same story everywhere - 80s/90s music (or no music at all), terrible sound system, very young crowd and mostly blackout drunk.

Not sure I'm missing out on something, but it's not the first time I experience this. I've tried several areas like De Pijp, Leidseplein, Rembrandplein and some bars near Oosterpark and it's all pretty much the same. Is house music and good sound system only reserved for festivals? Don't people like to listen to it on a regular weekend night? There are more djs per square meter than anywhere else, are they only doing house parties?

  
Edit: Got a few club recommendations, and counter arguments that I don't know how to have fun, but no real recommendation that has what I want. A small, walk in bar with good sound system and a local dj that plays deep house music. No entrance fees, no months ahead bookings, no big names. I can only assume that there aren't any and that is not the Dutch scene, which is fair enough, just strange for a country that is considered to be geared to electronic music.",1759573830.0,36,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1nxqh09/nightlife_in_amsterdam_sucks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1nxqh09/nightlife_in_amsterdam_sucks/,"Nightlife in Amsterdam sucks I was out yesterday with some friends, and I don't know if I wasn't drunk enough, or I'm not young enough, but everything I saw (and heard) was just......quite bad.

1nypy24,StudyInTheNetherlands,Looking for student housing in Amsterdam? Avoid HiCondo!,"(previously posted elsewhere)

Long story short, there's still a lot more that needs to be addressed, but if you're an international student looking for housing in Amsterdam, think twice before choosing HiCondo. Illegal security deposit amounts, illegal security deposit withholding, fraudulent service costs, and these are just the tip of the iceberg. I expect more to be published in the coming months. Note: I am one of the 20 tenants interviewed.
