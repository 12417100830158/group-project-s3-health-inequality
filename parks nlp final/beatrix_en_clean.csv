It's a small jewel, with recreation spots for children and families, and also for those who want to just sit in a quiet place and admire the flowers and the wildlife.

As well as many sculptures and artwork throughout the park, there are also many facilities such as a small swimming pool and playground for the kids, a fitness area, public toilets, and a nice cafe with a terrace.

251,5.0,"One of the nicest parks in Amsterdam, Beatrixpark was created in the years 1936-1938 following the design by Jakoba (Ko) Mulder, a leading Dutch landscape architect, who was also involved in the Amsterdamse Bos project. Originally a romantic park, after the WWII Beatrixpark has been redesigned into the more modern, style of functionalism. During the German occupation, the park has been called Diepenbrockpark, after the composer Alphons Diepenbrock, who was under the influence of the music of Richard Wagner and who in his compositions used often German romantic poetry. The street along the park remained named after the composer – Diepenbrockstraat.
As after the war, the style of the park changed and so changed its name. Today, the Beatrixpark is a green space behind the RAI congress centre, which took a large chunk of the land away from the park for the construction of one of it biggest exhibition halls, called later Parkhal. Another piece of land, directly at the freeway has been added at that time (1993), to compensate the loss.
Beatrixpark is a local park - nice, clean and quiet. Small pavilions standing in the park are leftovers from the Floriade exhibition in 1972. The oldest part of the park is the nicest, as it kept its original romantic character influenced by English parks - with a small lake and open landscape. Just this part of the Beatrixpark, has received the status of the city monument in 2005.",en,2019-08-20,Beatrixpark

Ik kon zien dat er natuur werd gevormd rond het water, dat begint in een meer waar in het midden een klein eiland is, een hoek van de vogels. Naast de verschillende soorten bomen en planten die zich aan de drie zijden door kanalen in al zijn dimensies uitstrekken.

Ik ben benieuwd om het op het hoogtepunt van de lente te observeren, vooral in de rozentuin en ook in de kruidentuin. Door de ingangen prachtige monumenten van leeuwen, die het gevoel geven dat daar de bewoners van deze plek veilig en beschermd zijn.
